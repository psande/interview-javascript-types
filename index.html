    <h1>Terms of the Exercise</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Try and stay away from libraries if possible</li>
      <li>
        You can take as long as you like to complete the exercise, but for an
        indicative timescale we expect a senior developer can accomplish this in
        an hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        You may use online resources to assist you with specific techniques,
        syntax etc. but please do not just copy code.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>The Challenge</h1>
    <p>
      The aim of the exercise is to demonstrate your problem solving and
      understanding of JavaScript by implementing something found in every unit
      testing tool - an "assertEquals" method.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Fill in the "assertEquals" function such that it will correctly compare
        the passed "expected" vs "actual" parameters.
      </li>
      <li>You may add more functions.</li>
      <li>
        We are big on TDD, so we expect you to complete this test using this
        approach.
      </li>
      <li>
        Credit will be given for approach, correctly identifying "failed"
        assertEquals, <b>clean, testable</b> code and coding style.
      </li>
      <li>
        The set of tests provided isn't exhaustive - there are cases that they
        don't handle. We expect you to add more tests.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Expected Result</h1>
    The following tests should "fail":
    <strong>02, 03, 04, 07, 08 and 09</strong> - and the failures should be
    reported using the provided mechanism.<br />
    We expect the following output for the lsit of tests we have provided, but
    we also expect you to add more tests:
    <ul class="expected">
      <li>Test 02: Expected "abcdef" found "abc"</li>
      <li>Test 03: Expected type Array but found type Object</li>
      <li>Test 04: Expected array length 2 but found 3</li>
      <li>Test 07: Expected propB.propA[1].propB "b" but found "c"</li>
      <li>Test 08: Expected propB.propC but was not found</li>
      <li>Test 09: Expected type Null but found type Object</li>
    </ul>
